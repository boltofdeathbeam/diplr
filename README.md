### What is diplr? 

**Diplr is a decentralized platform for intellectual property.**

Diplr will enable everyone with access to the internet to:

- Register files, text, ideas and any other tangible assets as intellectual property
- Verify the registration of intellectual property
- Sell and buy the rights of intellectual property

All of this happens without any middle man. Which means:

- You don't have to pay high fees to register your products or ideas
- Ownership and validity of registrations can be checked freely and is publicly available to anyone.
- Registrations are not in hands of a single entity, but the community as a whole.

Diplr is entirely built on smart contracts, maintaining the integrity of the process.

### Let's get technical

The reason Diplr can be an entirely decentralized and trustless entity, is because it's built on top of decentralized technologies.

#### Ethereum

All logic is implemented using solidity and deployed as smart contracts on the blockchain. There's no central, nor intermediary server which performs any logic. Central logic is performed on the blockchain and client side logic in the browser using javascript. 

#### IPFS

The web application that is used as an accesspoint to communicate with the underlying smart contracts will be available on ipfs. Furthermore, all extra data that will be stored, as well 

### Testing the application

The application can be tested locally, or on the Ropsten network. We'll keep the latest version in our master branch pointed to the latest version on the Ropsten network.
