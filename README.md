### What is diplr? 

**Diplr is a decentralized platform for intellectual property.**

Diplr will enable everyone with access to the internet to:

- Register files, text, ideas and any other tangible assets as intellectual property
- Verify the registration of intellectual property
- Sell and buy the rights of intellectual property

All of this happens without any middle man. Which means:

- You don't have to pay high fees to register your products or ideas
- Ownership and validity of registrations can be checked freely and is publicly available to anyone.
- Registrations are not in hands of a single entity, but the community as a whole.

Diplr is entirely built on smart contracts, maintaining the integrity of the process.

### Let's get technical

The reason Diplr can be an entirely decentralized and trustless entity, is because it's built on top of decentralized technologies.
